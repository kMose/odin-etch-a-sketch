First step is to make a 16x16 grid. We will get to the prompt later
try to print a grid of divs that have x inside of them.


for loop x 
    for loop y
        create an x div
    create a new container for the new x divs

flexbox column on the <div class=container>
    <div>xxxxxxx</div>
    <div>xxxxxxx</div>




.square{
    height: 5px;
    width: 5px;
}
    

need a function to remove grid
need a function to remake grid with x by x number of boxes
