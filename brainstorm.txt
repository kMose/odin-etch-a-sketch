features to add
change touch by user black background to black back regardless of class, so that we can overwrite colors without changing the class each time.

"pencil mode" - when pressed - cursor passes over box darken it by 10%
    Ideas:
        Make 10 darken classes. Each time its passed over add another class?
        Figure out how to increment HSL value

        make a function that reads hsl values and adds 10% to lightness value.
            function gets hsl as a parameter
                read and converts hsl(hue, saturation%, lightness%) lightness value to int.

                Increments int by 10 if value <100
                return int lightness
            insert style.backgroundColor = `hue%,sat%, ${lightness}%`
            

figure out slicing hsl
    do we need to toArray hsl to slice it.
