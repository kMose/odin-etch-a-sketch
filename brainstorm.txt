features to add
change touch by user black background to black back regardless of class, so that we can overwrite colors without changing the class each time.

"pencil mode" - when pressed - cursor passes over box darken it by 10%
    Ideas:
        Make 10 darken classes. Each time its passed over add another class?
        Figure out how to increment HSL value

        make a function that reads hsl values and adds 10% to lightness value.
            function gets hsl as a parameter
                read and converts hsl(hue, saturation%, lightness%) lightness value to int.

                Increments int by 10 if value <100
                return int lightness
            insert style.backgroundColor = `hue%,sat%, ${lightness}%`
            

figure out slicing hsl
    do we need to toArray hsl to slice it.
    what happens when we toArray HSL?


todo:
    hslString = "hsl(3, 100%, 10%)"
    hslArray = hslString.split(',');
    console.log(hslArray);

    let value = parseInt(hslArray[2], 10);
    console.log(`value is = ${value}`);

    we are going to split the hsl into an array using .split(,)
    hslArray[2] will hold our lightness value
    parse the hslArray[2] with parseInt will return our lightness value
    if (lightnessValue < 100)
        lightnessValue += 10;

    backgroundColor = `hsl(0, 0%, ${lightnessValue}%);

    --------This wont work because all values are RGB by default and I don't want to convert to hsl.------

    So we are going to normalize the RGB to 225,225,225 on first pass and decrement by 25 until ,,,.
